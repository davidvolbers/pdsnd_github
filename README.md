### Project Title
Programming for Data Science with Python: Exploring Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I wrote an interactive script that returns a statistical analysis of bikesharing data for three different cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. The script first asks you, for which city you would like to analyze data. Further, you can filter by month and/or day.

### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv (not staged)
new_york_city.csv (not staged)
washington.csv (not staged)

### Credits
Credits go out to Udacity and my mentors/reviewers.
